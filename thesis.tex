\noindent A \LaTeX\ class along with a simple template thesis are
provided here.  These can be used to easily write a thesis suitable
for submission at IIT-Delhi.  The class provides options to format
PhD, MS, M.Tech.\ and B.Tech.\ thesis.  It also allows one to write a
synopsis using the same class file.  Also provided is a BIB\TeX\ style
file that formats all bibliography entries as per the IITD format.

The formatting is as (as far as the author is aware) per the current
institute guidelines.

% Introduction.

\chapter{INTRODUCTION}
\label{chap:intro}

This document provides a simple template of how the provided
\verb+iitddiss.cls+ \LaTeX\ class is to be used.  Also provided are
several useful tips to do various things that might be of use when you
write your thesis.

To compile your sources run the following from the command line:
\begin{verbatim}
% pdflatex thesis.tex
% bibtex thesis
% pdflatex thesis.tex
% pdflatex thesis.tex
\end{verbatim}
Modify this suitably for your sources.

To generate PDF's with the links from the \verb+hyperref+ package use
the following command:
\begin{verbatim}
% dvipdfm -o thesis.pdf thesis.dvi
\end{verbatim}

\section{Package Options}

Use this thesis as a basic template to format your thesis.  The
\verb+iitddiss+ class can be used by simply using something like this:
\begin{verbatim}
\documentclass[PhD]{iitddiss}
\end{verbatim}

To change the title page for different degrees just change the option
from \verb+PhD+ to one of \verb+MS+, \verb+MTech+ or \verb+BTech+.
The dual degree pages are not supported yet but should be quite easy
to add.  The title page formatting really depends on how large or
small your thesis title is.  Consequently it might require some hand
tuning.  Edit your version of \verb+iitddiss.cls+ suitably to do this.
I recommend that this be done once your title is final.

To write a synopsis simply use the \verb+synopsis.tex+ file as a
simple template.  The synopsis option turns this on and can be used as
shown below.
\begin{verbatim}
\documentclass[PhD,synopsis]{iitddiss}
\end{verbatim}

Once again the title page may require some small amount of fine
tuning.  This is again easily done by editing the class file.

This sample file uses the \verb+hyperref+ package that makes all
labels and references clickable in both the generated DVI and PDF
files.  These are very useful when reading the document online and do
not affect the output when the files are printed.


\section{Example Figures and tables}

Fig.~\ref{fig:iitd} shows a simple figure for illustration along with
a long caption.  The formatting of the caption text is automatically
single spaced and indented.  Table~\ref{tab:sample} shows a sample
table with the caption placed correctly.  The caption for this should
always be placed before the table as shown in the example.


\begin{figure}[htpb]
  \begin{center}
    \resizebox{50mm}{!} {\includegraphics *{iitd_logo.png}}
    \resizebox{50mm}{!} {\includegraphics *{iitd_logo.png}}
    \caption {Two IITD logos in a row.  This is also an
      illustration of a very long figure caption that wraps around two
      two lines.  Notice that the caption is single-spaced.}
  \label{fig:iitd}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}

\begin{table}[htbp]
  \caption{A sample table with a table caption placed
    appropriately. This caption is also very long and is
    single-spaced.  Also notice how the text is aligned.}
  \begin{center}
  \begin{tabular}[c]{|c|r|} \hline
    $x$ & $x^2$ \\ \hline
    1  &  1   \\
    2  &  4  \\
    3  &  9  \\
    4  &  16  \\
    5  &  25  \\
    6  &  36  \\
    7  &  49  \\
    8  &  64  \\ \hline
  \end{tabular}
  \label{tab:sample}
  \end{center}
\end{table}

\section{Bibliography with BIB\TeX}

I strongly recommend that you use BIB\TeX\ to automatically generate
your bibliography.  It makes managing your references much easier.  It
is an excellent way to organize your references and reuse them.  You
can use one set of entries for your references and cite them in your
thesis, papers and reports.  If you haven't used it anytime before
please invest some time learning how to use it.

I've included a simple example BIB\TeX\ file along in this directory
called \verb+refs.bib+.  The \verb+iitddiss.cls+ class package which
is used in this thesis and for the synopsis uses the \verb+natbib+
package to format the references along with a customized bibliography
style provided as the \verb+iitd.bst+ file in the directory containing
\verb+thesis.tex+.  Documentation for the \verb+natbib+ package should
be available in your distribution of \LaTeX.  Basically, to cite the
author along with the author name and year use \verb+\cite{key}+ where
\verb+key+ is the citation key for your bibliography entry.  You can
also use \verb+\citet{key}+ to get the same effect.  To make the
citation without the author name in the main text but inside the
parenthesis use \verb+\citep{key}+.  The following paragraph shows how
citations can be used in text effectively.

More information on BIB\TeX\ is available in the book by
\cite{lamport:86}.  There are many
references~\citep{lamport:86,sai:16} that explain how to use
BIB\TeX.  Read the \verb+natbib+ package documentation for more
details on how to cite things differently.

Here are other references for example.  \citet{viz:mayavi} presents a
Python based visualization system called MayaVi in a conference paper.
\citet{pan:pr:flat-fst} illustrates a journal article with multiple
authors.  Python~\citep{py:python} is a programming language and is
cited here to show how to cite something that is best identified with
a URL.

\section{Other useful \LaTeX\ packages}

The following packages might be useful when writing your thesis.

\begin{itemize}
\item It is very useful to include line numbers in your document.
  That way, it is very easy for people to suggest corrections to your
  text.  I recommend the use of the \texttt{lineno} package for this
  purpose.  This is not a standard package but can be obtained on the
  internet.  The directory containing this file should contain a
  lineno directory that includes the package along with documentation
  for it.

\item The \texttt{listings} package should be available with your
  distribution of \LaTeX.  This package is very useful when one needs
  to list source code or pseudo-code.

\item For special figure captions the \texttt{ccaption} package may be
  useful.  This is specially useful if one has a figure that spans
  more than two pages and you need to use the same figure number.

\item The notation page can be entered manually or automatically
  generated using the \texttt{nomencl} package.

\end{itemize}

More details on how to use these specific packages are available along
with the documentation of the respective packages.
