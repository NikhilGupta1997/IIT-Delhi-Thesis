Mem2Seq paper used the following pre-processing on the data:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The subject (restaurant name) and object (rating) positions of the rating KB tuples in bAbI dialogs are flipped, while the order remains the same for other tuples remains the same. This pre-processing is illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:prebabi}
    \item an extra fact was added to the navigation tasks in In-Car Assistant with all the properties (such as distance, address) combined together  as the subject and \textit{poi} as the object. This pre-processing is illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:presmd}
\end{enumerate}
The pre-processing has major impact on the performance of  Mem2Seq, as it can only copy objects of a KB tuple, while the subject and relation can never be copied.

\subsection{bAbI Dataset Faults}
\label{sec:fault}
The KB entities present in validation and non-OOV test sets for task 3 and 4 do not overlap with those in the train set. This effectively means that non-OOV and OOV test conditions are the same for tasks 3 and 4. This explains the low performance of baseline models on task 3 and 4 non-OOV test sets.

\section{Example Predictions of \sys\ and Baselines}
\label{sec:examples}
Examples from SMD is shown in Table \ref{tab:smd0} respectively. Examples from KA test set with percentage of unseen entites set to 50 from CamRest and SMD are shown in Table \ref{tab:cam50} and Table \ref{tab:smd50} respectively. Examples from KA test set with percentage of unseen entites set to 100 from bAbI dialog Task 1 is shown in Table \ref{tab:t1_100}.
